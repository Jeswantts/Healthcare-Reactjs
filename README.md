# Healthcare
Bigbang Assessment

Background: In a healthcare organization, there is a need to establish a web-based platform that
enables seamless communication between administrators, doctors, and patients. The platform should
allow administrators to activate doctors, while patients can register and login to access medical
services. To ensure data security and user authentication, API consumption in Angular with JWT token
authentication is required.
